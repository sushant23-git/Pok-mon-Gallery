## 1. Project Overview

The Pokémon Gallery is a front-end web application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and Tailwind CSS. Its primary objective is to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for exploring the world of Pokémon. The project demonstrates proficiency in modern JavaScript (ES6+), asynchronous programming for API interactions, and dynamic DOM manipulation, all without relying on a larger front-end framework.

### Key Objectives:
- To create a fast, responsive, and intuitive user interface.
- To demonstrate effective integration with a third-party REST API.
- To build a feature-rich application using only fundamental web technologies.
- To implement modern UI/UX features like a theme toggle, smooth animations, and responsive design.
